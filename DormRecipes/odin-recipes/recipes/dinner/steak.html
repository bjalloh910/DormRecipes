                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to an hour before cooking. This helps to ensure more even cooking.</li>
                    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the air fryer is preheating, pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.</li>
                    <li>Rub the steak with olive oil on both sides. This will help the seasoning stick and add some extra flavor.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (if using). Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over both sides of the steak.</li>
                    <li>Once the air fryer is preheated, place the seasoned steak in the air fryer basket. Make sure the steak is not too crowded and has some space around it for even cooking.</li>
                    <li>Cook the steak in the air fryer at 400°F (200°C) for about 7-10 minutes, depending on your desired level of doneness and the thickness of the steak.</li>
                    <li>For medium-rare: Cook for about 7 minutes (internal temperature of around 130°F or 54°C).</li>
                    <li>For medium: Cook for about 8-9 minutes (internal temperature of around 140°F or 60°C).</li>
                    <li>For medium-well: Cook for about 9-10 minutes (internal temperature of around 150°F or 66°C).</li>
                    <li>Halfway through the cooking time, flip the steak over to ensure even cooking on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Use an instant-read meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. Remember that the temperature will continue to rise slightly after removing the steak from the air fryer.</li>
                    <li>Once the steak is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the air fryer and let it rest for a few minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
                    <li>Slice the steak against the grain and serve it hot.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Enjoy your perfectly cooked and juicy steak made in the air fryer! You can serve it with your favorite side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad. The air fryer provides a quick and convenient way to cook steak, and with a little seasoning, you'll have a delicious meal in no time.</p>
