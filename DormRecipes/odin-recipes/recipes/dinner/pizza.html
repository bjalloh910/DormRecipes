                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Reheat your air fryer to 375째F (190째C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Roll out or stretch the pizza crust to your desired thickness. If using a pre-made crust, make sure it fits inside your air fryer basket.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease the air fryer basket with olive oil or cooking spray to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Place the pizza crust in the greased air fryer basket.</li>
                    <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
                    <li>Add your favorite pizza toppings on top of the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the air fryer basket with the pizza into the preheated air fryer.</li>
                    <li>Air fry the pizza at 375째F (190째C) for about 8-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly golden, and the crust is crispy.</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye on the pizza during cooking to ensure it doesn't burn, as cooking times may vary based on the air fryer model and thickness of the crust.</li>
                    <li>Once the pizza is cooked, carefully remove the air fryer basket from the air fryer.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and let it cool for a moment.</li>
                    <li>Slice the pizza into wedges using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife.</li>
                    <li>Serve your delicious air fryer pizza hot and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">You can customize this pizza with your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings to create a pizza that suits your taste preferences. The air fryer will give your pizza a crispy crust and perfectly melted cheese, making it a quick and easy way to enjoy a homemade pizza.</p>
