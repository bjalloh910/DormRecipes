            <ol class="step-list">
                <li>reheat the Air Fryer: Preheat your air fryer to around 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Prepare the Salmon: Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel. This helps to remove excess moisture and ensures a crispy exterior.</li>
                <li>Season the Salmon: Brush both sides of the salmon fillets with a thin layer of olive oil or melted butter. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the fillets for extra flavor. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any optional herbs and spices you prefer.</li>
                <li>Place in the Air Fryer: Place the seasoned salmon fillets in the air fryer basket, ensuring they are not overlapping. If your air fryer is small, you might need to cook the fillets in batches.</li>
                <li>Cook the Salmon: Cook the salmon in the air fryer for about 8-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The general rule of thumb is to cook for about 5-6 minutes per 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of thickness. Keep an eye on the salmon to avoid overcooking. You can also check the doneness by using a fork to gently flake the salmon, it should easily separate into flakes.</li>
                <li>Serve: Once the salmon is cooked to your desired level of doneness, carefully remove it from the air fryer basket. Serve it immediately.</li>
                <li>Optional Garnishes: You can garnish your air-fried salmon with additional lemon slices, chopped fresh herbs, or a drizzle of extra olive oil.</li>
                <li>Enjoy: Your air-fried salmon is now ready to be enjoyed as a flavorful and nutritious meal!</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="end">Remember that cooking times might vary based on the thickness of the salmon fillets and the specific model of your air fryer. It's a good practice to start with a slightly shorter cooking time and then check for doneness before adding more time, as you can always cook it a little longer if needed.</p>
