                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a fork or potato masher until they are mostly mashed but still have some texture.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked quinoa or cooked brown rice, finely chopped onions, grated carrots, grated zucchini, chopped bell peppers, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to the mashed black beans. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the bread crumbs and all-purpose flour, mixing until the mixture holds together. The mixture should be firm enough to shape into patties.</li>
                    <li>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape each portion into a burger patty. The size of the patties can be adjusted based on your preference.</li>
                    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 375째F (190째C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease the air fryer basket with cooking spray or a little olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Place the veggie burger patties in the greased air fryer basket, leaving some space between them for even cooking.</li>
                    <li>Air fry the veggie burger patties at 375째F (190째C) for about 8-10 minutes on each side, flipping them over halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning and crispiness.</li>
                    <li>The veggie burgers are done when they are golden brown and heated through.</li>
                    <li>Remove the veggie burger patties from the air fryer and let them cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, toast burger buns in the air fryer for a minute or two.</li>
                    <li>Assemble your veggie burgers with your preferred toppings, such as lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, avocado slices, cheese, and condiments of your choice.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Enjoy your delicious and nutritious veggie burgers made in the air fryer! These burgers are packed with plant-based goodness and can be customized with your favorite toppings and condiments.</p>
