                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Preheat the Air Fryer: Preheat your air fryer to around 350°F (175°C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Pancakes: Take the desired number of frozen pancakes from the packaging. You can usually place them in a single layer without overlapping.</li>
                    <li>Grease the Air Fryer Basket: Lightly grease the air fryer basket with cooking spray or a small amount of oil. This will prevent the pancakes from sticking to the basket.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the Pancakes: Place the frozen pancakes in a single layer in the greased air fryer basket. Make sure to leave some space between the pancakes to allow for proper air circulation.</li>
                    <li>Cooking Time: The cooking time can vary depending on the thickness of the pancakes and the specific air fryer model. Generally, you'll want to cook the pancakes for about 5-8 minutes. However, it's a good idea to start with the lower end of the cooking time range and check on the pancakes to avoid overcooking.</li>
                    <li>Check for Doneness: After the initial cooking time, open the air fryer and check the pancakes. They should be golden brown and heated through. If needed, you can cook them for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Once the pancakes are cooked to your desired level of crispiness and warmth, carefully remove them from the air fryer using tongs or a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Optional Toppings: Serve the air-fried pancakes with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, butter, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or even a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy: Now you can enjoy your delicious and convenient air-fried frozen pancakes!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">This is such an easy and quick recipe. Enjoy your fluffy and delicious pancakes made in the air fryer! Feel free to add your own toppings.</p>
