                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 360°F (182°C). Check your air fryer's manual for specific preheating instructions.</li>
                    <li>Place the frozen waffles in a single layer in the air fryer basket. You can cook as many waffles as can fit without overlapping.</li>
                    <li>Cook the frozen waffles for about 3-4 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness and brand of the waffles.</li> 
                    <li>After the initial cooking time, check the waffles for doneness. They should be heated through and crispy on the outside.</li> 
                    <li>If the waffles need more time, you can cook them for an additional 1-2 minutes until they reach your desired level of crispiness.</li> 
                    <li>Carefully remove the cooked waffles from the air fryer using tongs or a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Serve the air-fried frozen waffles with your preferred toppings, such as butter, syrup, fruits, or whipped cream.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy your quick and easy air fryer-cooked frozen waffles!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Since frozen waffles are already cooked, using an air fryer to fully reheat them will result in crispier waffles. Make sure to keep an eye on the waffles while they cook because cooking durations may vary depending on the type and thickness of the waffles.</p>
