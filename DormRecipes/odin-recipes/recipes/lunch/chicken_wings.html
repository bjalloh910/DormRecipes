                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix together the baking powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the seasoning mixture over them. Toss the wings to coat them evenly with the seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease the air fryer basket with cooking spray or a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the seasoned chicken wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket, leaving space between them for even cooking. You may need to cook the wings in batches if your air fryer is not large enough to hold them all at once.</li>
                    <li>Air fry the chicken wings at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them over halfway through the cooking time. The cooking time may vary based on the size and thickness of the wings and the power of your air fryer.</li>
                    <li>The chicken wings are done when they are golden brown and crispy on the outside, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).</li>
                    <li>Remove the cooked chicken wings from the air fryer and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>If desired, toss the wings in your favorite sauce or seasoning while they are still hot. You can use classic Buffalo sauce, BBQ sauce, teriyaki sauce, honey garlic sauce, or simply sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning.</li>
                    <li>Serve the crispy air fryer chicken wings with your preferred dipping sauce and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Air-fried chicken wings are a delicious and healthier alternative to traditional fried wings.Feel free to customize the seasonings and sauces to suit your taste preferences!</p>
