                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Preheat your air fryer to 375째F (190째C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lay out the two slices of bread on a clean surface or plate.</li>
                    <li>Place one slice of cheese on one of the bread slices.</li>
                    <li>If you're adding any optional ingredients like ham, turkey, bacon, tomatoes, onions, or pickles, layer them on top of the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Place the second slice of cheese on top of the optional ingredients (if added).</li>
                    <li>Top with the second slice of bread to form a sandwich.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of softened butter or margarine on the outer sides of the sandwich. This will help the bread toast and become crispy in the air fryer.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the prepared grilled cheese sandwich in the air fryer basket.</li>
                    <li>Air fry the sandwich at 375째F (190째C) for about 4-6 minutes, flipping it over halfway through the cooking time. The cooking time may vary based on the size and thickness of your bread and the power of your air fryer.</li>
                    <li>The grilled cheese is ready when both sides are golden brown and the cheese inside has melted.</li>
                    <li>Remove the grilled cheese from the air fryer and let it cool slightly before slicing.</li>
                    <li>Cut the sandwich diagonally or into halves and serve it warm.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Enjoy your delicious and perfectly crispy grilled cheese sandwich made in the air fryer! The air fryer provides a quick and convenient way to make a classic comfort food, and you can customize the fillings to your liking.</p>
