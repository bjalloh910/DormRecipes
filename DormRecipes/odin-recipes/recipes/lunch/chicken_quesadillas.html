                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>Preheat the Air Fryer: Preheat your air fryer to around 350°F (175°C).</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Tortilla: Lay a flour tortilla on a clean surface.</li>
                    <li>Add Fillings: On one half of the tortilla, layer shredded cheese, cooked and shredded chicken, and any optional toppings like sliced bell peppers, onions, or jalapeños. Be careful not to overfill, as it might make folding and cooking difficult.</li>
                    <li>Fold the Tortilla: Fold the tortilla in half over the fillings, creating a half-moon shape.</li>
                    <li>Grease the Air Fryer Basket: Lightly grease the air fryer basket with cooking spray or a small amount of oil. This will help prevent sticking and aid in achieving a crispy texture.</li>
                    <li>Cook the Quesadilla: Place the folded quesadilla in the greased air fryer basket, making sure it's not overlapping. Cook for about 4-6 minutes, flipping it halfway through the cooking time.</li>
                    <li>Check for Doneness: After flipping, keep an eye on the quesadilla. It's done when it's golden brown and the cheese is melted and gooey. Cooking times may vary depending on your air fryer model and the thickness of the quesadilla.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Carefully remove the quesadilla from the air fryer basket and place it on a cutting board. Let it cool slightly before cutting it into wedges using a sharp knife or pizza cutter.</li>
                    <li>Optional Toppings: Serve your air-fried chicken quesadilla with optional toppings like sour cream, salsa, and guacamole on the side.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy: Now you can enjoy your tasty air-fried chicken quesadilla!</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="end">Remember that cooking times can vary based on the specific air fryer you're using, so keep an eye on the quesadilla to ensure it doesn't overcook. Adjust the cooking time as needed to achieve your preferred level of crispiness and cheese melt.</p>
